By default ``website_event`` module asks only three fields to fill about
attendees (name, email, phone). This module allows to customize any set
of fields.

Also,

-  if total bootstrap width of field columns is more that 12

   -  hides Header at Attendee form
   -  shows field name above each input

-  If user is authenticated:

   -  first attendee at the form will have autofilled values (if person
      is not registered yet)

-  Modifies behaviour of ``partner_event`` module:

   -  always updates Registration's name and phone to corresponded
      values of Attendee Partner, because they may be taken from Partner
      record (e.g. Public User)

   -  If attendee partner exists and current (authenticated) user is the
      attendee partner himself: update partner values. (We don't update
      fields always, because it leads to security issue: anyone can
      change partner name, passport, etc. just knowing his email).
      Default behaviour: only create partner if one doesn't exist.

-  Prevents changing qty for event lines (TODO: move this to a separate
   module)

-  Custom redirection after filling ticket form, e.g. to cart page to
   ask for coupons (TODO: move this to a separate module). Create System
   Parameter ``website_event_sale.redirection`` to configure it.

Configuration
=============

-  Open menu ``Event``
-  Select or create Event
-  At ``Website Fields`` tab update list of fields

Usage
=====

-  Open ``/event`` page
-  Select desired Event
-  Select quantity of tickets and click ``[Order Now]``
-  RESULT: specified fields are shown
-  Fill the fields and proceed checkout
-  Go back to backend. Open menu ``Event``
-  Check new attendee(s) of the Event
-  Result: Attendee(s) fields are stored in **Contact** record

Email field at the form
-----------------------

-  When email column is presented and there is a partner with that
   email:

   -  if partner has confirmed registration for the event:

      -  registration is blocked. Warning is shown

   -  if partner has some of fields

      -  grey them out with a message "This email address already has an
         account. Data will be taken from this account"

-  Registration form doesn't allow to register two attendees with the
   same email

-  When partner record exists before purchasing the module and current
   user is not that partner, then new partner's details are posted under
   registration form as a message. Such cases has to be handled
   manually, because we cannot update them automatically to partner for
   security reasons.
